# Framework UI - React Tech Stack Alternatives

This repository provides three different React-based UI implementations to demonstrate various tech stack approaches for building modern web applications. Each alternative showcases different tools, libraries, and architectural patterns while maintaining the same core functionality.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

All three alternatives include:
- **Authentication Flow**: Login/logout with JWT token management
- **Protected Routes**: Route guards and automatic redirects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive layouts
- **API Integration**: Different approaches to API communication
